Frosty Zygo Fletcher

Fungal Shafts - Start near the Zygomites will train Firemaking and Fletching on zygomites - MAKE SURE YOU SET THE CONFIGURE OPTION INGAME TO CUT AND DRY
Sharp Shells - Start near Pile of dinosaur eggs

I will add the final part "Dinosaur propellant" however i only have 1 account to test on and it doesnt currently have the firemaking level

Im not good at UIs you will have to pause+play in bot with us and start+stop in script when you wish to swap methods (I will improve this down the line)
